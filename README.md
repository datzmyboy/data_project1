# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project

This project explores a pizza sales dataset using Python and SQL to uncover key business insights.
I obtained the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/pizza-sales].

Below are the three analytical questions I designed — as if I were working for this pizza company — to support operational and strategic decision-making:




**Question 1 – Highest Revenue Pizza:** <small>Which pizza generates the highest total revenue?</small>

### Highest Revenue Pizza: Which pizza generates the highest total revenue?

The results from the query show the **top 3 best-selling pizzas**:

1. **thai_ckn (large, chicken type)**
2. **five_cheese (large, veggie type)**
3. **four_cheese (large, veggie type)**

As illustrated in the graph, the **thai_ckn large chicken pizza generates the highest total revenue**, amounting to **$29,257.50**, which represents **37.6% of the revenue among the top 3 pizzas**.  

This indicates that the large chicken variant of the Thai chicken pizza is the most popular and contributes the largest portion of sales within the top-selling pizzas. Showing the top 3 pizzas provides context for comparison and highlights other high-performing pizzas.


**Question 2 -  Peak Sales by Month, Day, and Hour**: <small>For the pizza with the highest revenue, in which month, day, and hour does it sell the most?</small>

### Peak Sales by Month: For the Thai Chicken (Large) Pizza

The analysis shows that the **Thai Chicken (Large) pizza** achieves its highest revenue in **July and December**, each generating approximately **₱2,801.25** from **135 orders**.  

This trend suggests that demand increases during **mid-year holidays** and **year-end celebrations**, reflecting seasonal buying behavior. February shows a slight dip, likely due to the post-New Year period, while sales steadily rise from March to July, dip slightly in August, and remain high through December.
